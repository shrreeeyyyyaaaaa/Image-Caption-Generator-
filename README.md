Every day, we encounter a large number of images from various sources such as the internet, 
news articles, document diagrams and advertisements. These sources contain images 
that viewers would have to interpret themselves. Most images do not have a 
description, but the human can largely understand them without their detailed 
captions. However, machine needs to interpret some form of image captions if humans 
need automatic image captions from it. Image captioning is important for many 
reasons. Captions for every image on the internet can lead to faster and descriptively 
accurate images searches and indexing. Ever since researchers started working on 
object recognition in images, it became clear that only providing the names of the 
objects recognized does not make such a good impression as a full human-like 
description. As long as machines do not think, talk, and behave like humans, natural 
language descriptions will remain a challenge to be solved. 
Image captioning has various applications in various fields such as biomedicine, 
commerce, web searching and military etc. Social media like Instagram , Facebook etc 
can generate captions automatically from images. 

**Dataset : FLICKR8K DATASET** 
Flickr8k dataset is a public benchmark dataset for image to sentence description. This 
dataset consists of 8000 images with five captions for each image. These images are 
extracted from diverse groups in Flickr website. Each caption provides a clear description 
of entities and events present in the image. The dataset depicts a variety of events and 
scenarios and doesn‟t include images containing well-known people and places which 
makes the dataset more generic. The dataset has 6000 images in training dataset, 1000 
images in development dataset and 1000 images in test dataset. Features of the dataset 
making it suitable for this project are: 
• Multiple captions mapped for a single image makes the model generic and avoids overfitting of the model. 
• Diverse category of training images can make the image captioning model to work for multiple categories of images and hence can make the model more robust
